# API-REST
*Programming concepts, in this case with practical code, the API concept*
## Iterface Programming Aplication 
    The API also allows us to facilitate access to data or resources that have already been designed, with the API being an interface that allows us to reuse that functionality to access those resources or data that have already been previously established, which boils down to not reinventing the wheel.
**They do not need to know internal details of the other applications, which is a great advantage of the API, they work between different software.**

### Characteristics:
- *Modularity:* Property that allows an application to be subdivided into smaller parts (called modules), each of which must be as independent as possible from the application itself and from the remaining parts.
- *Scalabilty:* Software scalability refers to its ability to handle an increasing load of data and work, in other words, the ability of a system to continue meeting the needs of your business as it grows.
